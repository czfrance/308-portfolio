# Final Masterpiece

The code in this folder represents what you feel represents your **best designed** work from this project
that you want to be reviewed in detail by your mentor UTA.

This code **must** be an exact copy (with the same name) of **complete** Java files from the project where:
 * every public method must be commented using Javadoc and every non-public method must 
   include an inline comment briefly describing its purpose as well (like my example code)
 * every class must have an added comment at the top describing its purpose and why you
   think it is well-designed (i.e., what you think it shows what you have learned from 
   the course)

This file is for informational purposes only and does not need to be modified.
