## Starting a Big Project

### Initial impression of team
I thought my team was very nice! Jose and Diane are both cool people seem willing to learn and put
effort into their projects. However, I also got the feeling that they wouldn't be upset at leaving
something half finished or a more basic version, which I'm not completely sure how I feel about.

### First team meeting experience
Since the beginning, we've had trouble scheduling time to meet as a team. First we arranged for one
time, but then had to change due to someone's activities. As such, we weren't able to meet for a 
very long time as a group of 3. Since then, we haven't met up in person or even on zoom except for
in class. Regarding this, I am quite frustrated as this meant we were behind on the project.

### First design challenge
For me personally, my first design challenge was whether to use a controller, and if so, 
if we were supposed to use one or multiple (per simulation). In the end, I decided to go with no
controller as it wouldn't do much. Another challenge I ran into was Cell subclasses. Although my
teammates (and me too, initially) think that there should be a Cell subclass for each state (ie 
burning, alive, empty, filled), I now think that there should be a subclass or two per simulation
(ie GameOfLifeCell, GroupCell, FireCell, and then 2 types of cells for WaTor: FishCell and SharkCell).
We still need to discuss this.

As for what we decided to tackle first, we agreed that the XML parser would have to be completed/working
first before we can really start on the project, so I started with that.

### First piece of code
My first piece of code was the XML parser. I took inspiration from the example given in class and was
able to adapt it for use in our project. I also created an example XML file with a basic grid 
configuration. It took sort of a long time, but in the end it was successful, so I am happy. After that,
I worked on creating a model and view and basic logic to pass the XML file information between 
everything and draw cells in the view.

### Hardest part or biggest obstacle
By far the hardest part came when we first started the project. Jose and I were both working on the
project at the same time and since the project was just starting off, we both made many changes to many 
of the files, so I had to spend around 3 hours resolving conflicts :(:(

### First coding session insights
We haven't had an official coding session yet, but in lab we got started on the project. I don't
want to look negatively upon my team member, but I felt that it was mainly Jose and I doing the work
for both the lab and the project. So far, Diane has not made a single contribution to the labs and 
projects that we have worked on together code-wise. We wrote code together for around 1 hour, and then
Jose and I went back and worked on it for many hours (at least 3 for Jose, 6 for me) that night. 
Tiredness and merge conflicts were the main things that got in my way as I was programming.

### Successful outcome
The most successful outcome would of course be meeting all the requirements of the project as well
as having well designed code. This would mean abstract classes, many classes, and clean, documented code.

On the teammate side, the best outcome would be that we all equally contribute to the project

### Worst possible outcome
The work possible outcome would be that we do not implement all the simulations and our code is
both messy and buggy. 

On the teammate side, the worst outcome would be that only one or two people do the work and this
work results in lots of conflicts that take up even more time to fix. Along with communication 
problems and different ideas for how to do things (that don't get resolved/talked about)
