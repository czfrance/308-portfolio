### JOURNAL PROMPTS
1. Provide 5 separate completions for the sentence "I am ..."
Write 5 non-negative "I am" statements with each on a separate line. 
They can be positive, such as "I am a good debugger" or "I am honest" or 
"I am a hard worker". They can be neutral, such as "I am a procrastinator" or "I am funny". 
Try to avoid negative statements such as "I am bad at math" or "I am not confident".
2. How did you become interested in Computer Science?
3. How do you use programming outside of class, in your daily life?
4. Describe a favorite programming project you have worked on.
5. Describe your best or worst programming experience.
6. What is your primary motivation for taking this course?
7. What, if any, steps do you take to deliberately plan and design the code you write?
8. Would you encourage a younger relative to pursue Computer Science?
If so, what advice would give them? If not, what would your concerns be?
9. What role, if any, do you think Computer Scientists should have in solving societal-level problems?
10. How do you see yourself using your Computer Science skills in the future?

### I AM Statements
* I am learning
* I am positive
* I am hardworking
* I am realistic
* I am excited for this class

### Why Study Computer Science

To be quite honest, I *hated* computer science at first. My first experience with programming 
was at a "learning program" my dad's work hosted for high school students. I was really excited
going in, but quickly discovered that while you *technically* didn't need to have any prior
knowledge, everyone else in the room did, which resulted in the organizers increasing the 
complexity of the class. I was not ready for that. At all. Work sessions consisted of me
living exclusively on stack exchange, not that that helped, since I didn't even know what a 
`String` was.

I left the program utterly defeated. But apparently I didn't learn my lesson, because my friends
managed to convince me to take a CS course at my high school with them. This, unlike, my previous experience,
however, was probably the best thing that happened. I had a blast. Not only
were things *finally* making sense, I really enjoyed creating programs from scratch, and my teacher
really enjoyed helping us do so. 

So now, here I am 4 years later in yet another CS class, all because of my friends and one amazing
teacher. 

Why Computer Science? Because I love it. I love being able to create everything from nothing,
turn fantasies into reality, and be in an environment where quite literally everything is at 
the tip of my fingers.

### How you use programming
Almost everything that we use on a daily basis is a result of some type of programming. I use my
computer to browse the internet, I use my DukeCard to get food, and I'm practically glued to
my phone. So, it's safe to say that I use programming to...live?

### Favorite Programming Project
My intern project from last summer was to create a media service that handled uploads to the
company's application via AWS. It was my first introduction to AWS, and although I was slightly
overwhelmed, I had a blast building the service & playing around with everything AWS had to offer.

### Memorable Programming Experience
(Continuing on from above) 

Last summer, I was a backend intern at a startup company. I was really nervous at the beginning
because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to contribute anything, but my manager and everyone else
on the team were all so nice, patient, and helpful. So I'd say that my most memorable programming
experience didn't include any actual programming, but rather the people and experienced that I 
met & had along the way. 

### CompSci 308 Motivation
I've never taken a purely project based computer science course. Although I heard that this
class was a lot of work, I want to challenge myself, learn a lot, meet & work with new people, 
and improve. 

I hope that this class will be a great way for me to improve at doing what I hope to do in 
the future.

### Planning and Designing Code
To be quite honest, I'm not the best at planning out code. Prior to taking CS 250, I'd always 
started projects with a goal and a rough idea of what needs to happen in mind, and then 
worked my way through it. I know this isn't the best, so I've been trying to write important
stuff down and take notes about features & other relevant information before starting. I still
have a long way to go though.

### Advice for Next Generation
I would definitely encourage a younger relative to at least give Computer Science a try. I think
it's something that everyone should at least know the basics of, just because it's rapidly 
becoming (and already is) an integral part of our lives.

As for advice, I'd tell them to take it slow and from the beginning. At least for me, I found
that having a knowledgeable and passionate teacher was a really important for fostering 
excitement and interest. This is different for everyone, though, because I know plenty of people
who taught themselves everything. Other than that, have fun!

### Societal Role of Computer Science
With how ingrained technology is in society, Computer Scientists have the potential to 
affect every aspect of everyone's lives. Although others may have ideas, in the end it's the
Computer Scientists that are designing, implementing, and maintaining everything.

### Applying Computer Science Skills in the Future
As of now, my goal is to work as a SWE after graduation, so hopefully I'll be able to use my 
skills to build/improve whatever needs to be improved!
