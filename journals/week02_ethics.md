## Ethics Essay

### Specific helpful computing technology example
During the beginning of first semester freshman year, my friend was accepted into a dance
team at Duke. As a member of her dance team, she was required to travel a bit, so we worked
out a system where she'd tell me where she would be, and I would stay connected with her 
phone/check in on her location periodically to make sure that nothing was wrong. I'd also 
always have my ringer on in case she needed me for anything. This would not have been 
possible without technology.

### Specific harmful computing technology example
This has happened to many people, but my friend's dad had many of his accounts hacked. His
identity, credit cards, passwords, and everything else were stolen. All technology comes with
its dangers, and a breach in security is one of them. 

### Computing technology trend for society
I think generally, technology is a very big positive for most people/society. It has brought
countless benefits, such as connecting people across the globe and drastically increasing
the amount of resources available to each person. Today, so much is possible that no one
would've even imagined a few decades back.

### Computing technology's role in ethics
Technology definitely introduces a variety of unique and novel ethical challenges. Everything
has its own ethical challenges, and every new thing introduces new ethical challenges. Thus,
computing technology, which is relatively new, introduces many unique ethical challenges. It
has added an entire new realm to our world, so it is natural that new challenges develop as a
result.

### Article response/how you can learn more about ethics
I completely agree with both what the article argues and what it suggests as a solution.
Although computing is very important, we have lost sight of the purpose we are building such
technology: for people. Thus, we must integrate ethics into everything that we do and build.
I'm glad that universities (including Duke now) and companies are beginning to realize what
we were lacking before and taking steps to change.


## Failure Essay

### Personal Experience
Freshman year of high school, I decided to take a leap of faith and join our school's Speech &
Debate team. Up to that point, I had been massively uncomfortable talking in front an audience
larger than 5, and I recognized that that needed to change. At my first speech competition, I 
was incredibly nervous. And quite predictably, I failed spectacularly. Not only did I fail to
remember any part of my speech, I even managed to misread my note card and skip an entire point.

Speech competitions usually have multiple (2 or 3) rounds. After my first round, the last thing
I wanted to do was walk myself to yet another classroom and give my speech all over again.
However, I told myself that in order to change, you need to keep on going. So I forced myself 
to continue on and make it through the rest of the competition.

Although none of my rounds that day went well, I gradually improved as the year went on. By the
end of senior year, I was leaps and bounds above where I had started. And although I'm still
not the best speaker, I can at least stand in front of a group of people and make my point.

From this experience, I learned that failing is scarily easy, and trying again sometimes takes
more courage than you think you have. However, if you can somehow find a way to continue on,
you will eventually emerge from the other side an improved person.

### Quotes about failure (prompts for the above reflection)

 * Failure is important

 * Failure is a momentary event

 * Fail often in order to succeed sooner

 * Failing is easy; trying again takes courage

 * Failure can be controlled
