### Project Scope

* Challenging design issue you have worked on
  * A design issue I worked on was how to properly distinguish between the views that will be 
    implemented, as well as the pause screen/button new screen feature. I'm still not sure
    what the best solution is, but I was trying to figure out which class should have control of 
    the button that would bring up a new screen, and where the function/instructions for that 
    button would lie, since it depends a lot on the rest of the view.
  * I had trouble deciding how accessible to the rest of the project I wanted to make the buttons.
    In the end, I decided to have all button functionality in the most specific class, so that 
    the button wouldn't have to be passed along/made in a class that's much more general/high up in
    the hierarchy than it should be.
  
* Most challenging design issue the team has faced
  * The most challenging issue tha team has faced was how to define piece rules and win 
    conditions. Specifically, what "language"/syntax did we want to make to specify what pieces
    had what rules, and how to decide if the game has been won, and by who?
  * For the engine, a design issue that we are contemplating right now is how to distinguish
    between the action of selecting a piece and the action of "moving".

* Best aspect of working on a project of this size
  * The best aspect of working on a project of this size is that I don't have to worry about
    every single aspect of the project and trust that others will take care of their role. This 
    has been immensely stress-relieving and has allowed me to take a step back and chill a bit.

* Most challenging aspect of working on a project of this size
  * The most challenging aspect is essentially the same as the best aspect. While it's nice not 
    having to worry about every part of the project, it's also very scary because I don't know
    exactly what is going on and what decisions are being made, as well as what people have done
    so far. When I pull code, I have to figure out what all has been changed, and how that impacts
    what I'm doing. 

* Best aspect of working on a project with this many people
  * In addition to what I said above about not having to work on every single part of the proejct
    and stress about it, the best part about working with so many pepople is that the project can have so many
    moving and working elements and features, and that all of that is within scope, because 
    we have so many people so work can be divided up accordingly.

* Most challenging aspect of working on a project with this many people
  * Most challenging aspect is definitely communication. With so big of a group, it's bound
    to be hard to communicate everything that's going on, so I guess it's natural to feel a bit
    in the dark about what other people are doing. I'm not going to lie, part of this is definitely
    my fault. I've had such a hard couple of weeks mentally and personally, and that has severely
    impacted my ability to do work and contribute to the team.


### Visualize Success Practices

* Visualize and then describe what would be a successful outcome for this project
  * A successful outcome for this project would be to meet our goal of creating a no code 
    customizable game that can be played by anyone! For me personally, this would mean
    making the frontend/UI look very aesthetic, as well as being able to incorporate every single
    feature the backend implements, as well as some of my own ideas, such as noises when a piece 
    is clicked on.

* Visualize and then describe what would be a unsuccessful outcome for this project
  * An unsuccessful outcome for this project would be having a buggy project that does not meet
    the requirements of the project specification, especially not being able to fully connect 
    the building and engine halves of the project.

* Things you personally have control over to help make it successful 
  * Since I am the only one working on front end engine for this project, I have complete control
    over how successful that part of it is, including its look and its features. I hope to make it 
    as amazing as possible.
