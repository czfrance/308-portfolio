### Contributions and Roles

* Describe your role(s) and your satisfaction
  * My role for this project was to work on the view of the engine. The engine is the part of the
    project where the game is actually played. In general, we broke our project up into two parts:
    builder and engine. Builder allows the user to build their own game, while engine allows the
    user to play a game, either one that they built, or one that is already preloaded into the 
    application.
  * The View of the engine consists of many different windows that ask for and display a variety
    of information, ranging from uploading/selecting a game, to player mode select (1 or 2 players),
    to selecting AI difficulty (if 1 player), to actually playing the game, as well as navigation 
    between these screens. 
  * I implemented the majority of these screens (with the exception of the dashboard/game selection)
    window, as well as created themes and languages for all the screens.
  * I made sure that what was created in the backend/model is implemented/reflected in the front end,
    so that what they created is properly displayed for the users to use.
  * In general, I am satisfied with the role I've played. At first, I felt that I was slacking, but 
    now that I've gotten the time to work on the project a bit, I feel happier with the contributions
    I've made to the team.

* Describe your team mate(s) role(s) and their satisfaction

    * Jake Heller: Jake's role was to work on the backend of the engine, more specifically
      figuring out how to implement rules, moves, and conditions to pieces and the board. I am very
      satisfied with his contributions. Jake essentially took lead of the engine, and I am very
      thankful for his expertise, wisdom, and dedication to the project.

    * Robert: Robert's role was to work a bit on the backend and a bit on the frontend of the 
      engine. He took care of some of the logic behind the games, and also made sure some of that
      was implemented in the front end. I am also satisfied with his contributions. Robert has made
      significant impact on the engine. 

    * Alexander: Alexander's role was to work on the AI part of the engine. This includes figuring 
      out how to decide what moves are to be made, its time limit, and difficulty. I am moderately
      satisfied with his contributions. I'm sure the AI is a lot of work, so I am thankful for what 
      he has done, but a lot of the time it feels like he talks a lot but never actually does what 
      he says. 
  
    * Haris: I'm not quite sure what Haris' role was. I believe he mainly worked on the backend
      conditions of the engine and some other game functions. I am moderately satisfied with his 
      contributions. As I stated above, I'm not sure what Haris did, but I'm sure that he has at 
      least contributed some to the project.

    * Shaan: Shaan's role on the team was to work on parsing as well as figuring out how to 
      translate user demands into JSON that the application can interpret for game play in the 
      builder. The builder and engine teams were pretty separate, so I'm not sure of the details of 
      what else Shaan did, but I believe he also worked a bit on the front end. I'm very satisfied
      with his contributions. It is clear how much he was done for this project.

    * Ricky: Rickys' role on the team is to work on figuring out how to
      translate user demands into JSON that the application can interpret for game play in the
      builder as well as helping out with the front end. I am satisfied with his contributions. It
      is clear that he put a lot of thought into this project and I appreciate his work.

    * Mike & Thivya: Mike and Thivya's roles on this project were to work on the front end for the 
      builder. They worked on tabs, as well as making everything look nice and building the logic
      for the builder. I am satisfied with their work.

* Roles beyond coding you took on and their benefit
  * Beyond coding, I went to most of the team meetings that we had in person, barring health and 
    personal reasons, including my roommate and friend getting covid, and mental health reasons.

* People who generally took on work "between assigned responsibilities" and outcome for the team
  * In general, the people who took on work "between assigned responsibilities" where Jake and Shaan.
    It felt like they were consistently on top of the work and looking ahead at what needs to get 
    done. As a result, they have kept our team on track and made sure that everything was good to
    go.


### Team Events

* Describe when you felt the most satisfaction
  * I felt the most satisfaction when the backend and frontend of the engine were united together and
    all the buttons worked, so that the application was actually usable.
  * This felt great because everything flowed together nicely and it came together well.

* Describe when you felt the team made the biggest leap ahead
  * I think the team make the biggest leap ahead when we connected everything. This was when 
    the entire game was working and it felt like the previous small contributions we had 
    made all added up to this one moment.

* Describe how conflict was handled within the team
  * Conflict within the team was handled with discussions, either in person on over slack, involving
    multiple people, not just the people what were initially involved in the conflict.

* Describe problem(s) with the way the team worked together
  * The main thing for working together is staying on top of what the team is doing/knowing 
    where everyone is at.


### Learning Opportunities

* Your biggest strength as a teammate
  * I think my biggest strength is my work ethic and stubbornness. I don't like to leave things
    unfinished, so I will often work until the goal that I set out for myself I reached. I am
    very passionate about what I do, and when that is the case, I will dedicate as much time
    into the project as needed until the result is something I am satisfied and can be proud
    of.

* Your biggest weakness as a teammate
  * My weakness is my lack of knowledge and also lack of ability to assert myself. In a sense,
    I guess that stems from the idea that I am very open to everything, and don't have much
    in the way of preferences/thoughts for how things should be done. I am very go along with the
    flow, and as such, people may view me as a pushover or not participating much. I should work
    on this aspect of myself.

* Things you have learned about team collaboration/communication
  * I've learned a lot about team collaboration and communication through this team project 
    experience specifically. In my previous teams, the teams were very disorganized and didn't really
    know what was going on. However, this one has been the most organized and consistently 
    communicating with the team, both about what people did, as well as discussing options for 
    how to implement and do things. Feedback was also delivered and received nicely. 
  * Through this experience, I learned that in terms of communication, more is always better.
    Although it might feel like spam sometimes, it's always good to err on the side of talking/
    saying too much instead of not enough.

* Specific things you can do to ensure successful team outcomes in the future
  * To ensure successful team outcomes in the future, I can make sure to communicate more and 
    facilitate team discussion. This is extremely important, both so that the team stays on track
    as well as making sure everyone feels included. Another thing that I could do is make sure 
    that tasks are divvied up properly. It's important to know that one person cannot do everything
    and that there are many people on a team so that responsibilities can be split up evenly to 
    distribute the stress and workload.
