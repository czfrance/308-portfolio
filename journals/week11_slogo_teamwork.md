### Contributions and Roles

* Describe your role(s) and your satisfaction
  * My role in the team was to be the glue that connects the backend and the frontend. I was
    responsible for creating all the functionality of the turtle in the backend and then reflecting
    those actions in the front end. 
  * In the backend, I created the backend turtle as well as kept track of all of its properties 
    and wrote all of its functions. I ensured that the correct instructions passed in from the compiler 
    would be executed. 
  * On the frontend, I designed and created the turtle, as well as coded its movement paths (path and
    rotate transitions), and took care of the additional frontend heavy turtle functions such as 
    show/hide and pen up/down. I also created the general view/sketchbook that the turtle would be 
    drawing & moving on. 
  * All of these extend to the extension projects we did, such as multiple turtles (adjusting our 
    code so that we can support the movement of multiple turtles)
  * In summation, I ensured that if correct instructions were passed to the turtle, then the turtle 
    would be able to accurately and properly change its properties to reflect the instructions, and 
    for these instructions to be visually represented in the front end.
  * For this project, I worked closely with Brandon, who was working on the compiler. Our main overlap
    was ensuring that the instructions he parsed can be accurately passed to the turtle.
  * All in all, I am satisfied with the work that I've done. I think I contributed significantly
    to the group and played an important role in making the project successful.
  

* Describe your teammate(s) role(s) and their satisfaction

    * TEAMMATE #1: Brandon Bae
      * Brandon was in charge of the compiler. The function of the compiler is to split up the 
        complicated instructions from the user (passed in from the console) into its base
        instructions. Once this is done, the compiler inserts all the basic instructions into a queue
        for the turtle to read from. As part of the compiler, Brandon took care of all checking for
        valid instructions.
      * I am very satisfied with Brandon's work and as a teammate. He was responsible and took 
        initative to reach out and improve the project

    * TEAMMATE #2: Thivya Sivarajah
      * Thivya was in charge of purely frontend design. She connected all the front end components
        that previously existed (console, sketchbook/turtle screen) to the opening window that she 
        created so that our program would flow correctly. She also added all the buttons, and other
        frontend design elements.
      * I am satisfied with Thivya's work and as a teammate. She was great to work with, although
        she was also very busy with dance, so didn't get to contribute as much.

    * TEAMMATE #3: Prajwal Jagadish
      * Prajwal was in charge of the console. The function of the console is to take in the
        instructions from the user.
      * I am somewhat satisfied with Prajwal's work and as a teammate. His work on the console was great,
        but it feels like some of the time he was absent and wasn't great a communication. As such,
        I'm not completely sure what he has done for the project.
    

### Team Events

* Describe when you felt the most satisfaction
  * I felt the most satisfaction at the end of the project. It was great to see everything (the console,
    compiler, and turtle) connected up. Although we ran into some problems along the way, the connection
    was done largely synchronously, so it was great seeing everyone working together. There was also
    lots of satisfaction when things worked
  * Another time I felt a lot of satisfaction was working on multiple turtles with Brandon. We met 
    over zoom spontaneously for around an hour and just hammered out all of the things we needed
    to do to connect everything. In the end, it worked a lot sooner than we both expected, so that 
    was a great experience. We also played off of each other in terms of ideas.

* Describe when you felt the team made the biggest leap ahead
  * In terms of the team, the biggest leap ahead definitely came when everything got connected
    together. Although everything had worked separately up until that point, the project felt 
    disorganized since nothing coherent was put together. After that point though, our project
    felt more whole
  * On a personal level, the biggest leap for me was definitely getting all the functions to be 
    accurately relfected on the front end. It took me a lot of time and research to get to that point,
    and to see everything displayed felt great.

* Describe way(s) the team has worked well
  * The team worked well in each doing what they were supposed to do. Compared to my last group, this
    team was infinitely more responsible. It was clear that I was SIGNIFICANTLY less stressed 
    because I trusted my teammates to do what they were supposed to do.
  * In particular, I remember one lab when we came together to discuss our progress, and everyone 
    had done a majority of what they were supposed to do.

* Describe problem(s) with the way the team worked together
  * I think we could've done a better job splitting up the work. In particular, I feel as if Prajwal
    and Thivya could've been assigned more responsibilities, probably taking some of the weight off
    of Brandon.


### Learning Opportunities

* Your biggest strength as a team member
  * I think my biggest strength as a team member is contributing to the functionality of the
    project. Especially for this one, I took care of everything related to the turtle (backend 
    and frontend), so I think I contributed significantly to that part of the team.
  * In particular, I think my value as a team member comes from the progress that I make to 
    further the project. 

* Your biggest weakness as a team member
  * In terms of design, I know for a fact that both Brandon and Thivya are better at design. They 
    are constantly thinking about it and looking for ways to improve. This is something that I 
    still need to work on, as I don't always think about design first. 
  * As I discussed with Kathleen in one of our meetings, I need to make a habit of refactoring
    earlier or thinking about design first and going with a better designed solution the first 
    time instead of fixing it later.

* How you can better advocate for your needs from others
  * This definitely stems from communication. For this project, I think I made a lot of assumptions
    about how Brandon would be taking care of the compiler and adding instructions to the queue.
    Specifically, we disagreed on if the instruction queue would have a turtle, or the other way
    around. For next time, I will definitely ask straight up what his plan is. 

* Learning about team collaboration/communication
  * I've learned so much about team collaboration and communication in this team. As I mentioned 
    earlier, my Cell Society team was very bad at communication, collaboration, and responsibility. 
    I really enjoyed that we got together in a conference room to have long discussions about our code,
    or even when we were working on labs together. The energy felt great-- everyone was comfortable
    both giving and receiving feedback/suggestions. 

* Specific thing(s) can you do to make team collaboration/communication more productive
  * Sometimes we got sidetracked or looked too much into the weeds/details and speculation. In the
    future, I could team collaboration/communication more productive by keeping us on track and 
    continuing to discuss what we set out to discuss.
