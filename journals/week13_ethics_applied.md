## Scenario #1

### If you do not have any ethical concerns as presented, what change to the scenario would create issue(s)?
* I think I need more information on this situation. If the manufacturer had specified clearly to both 
  the customers and the percent of faulty machines, and this percentage is accepted, then that would
  be fine. However, if this is something that the manufacturer is specifically trying to hide, then
  this is 100% not acceptable.

### How would handle the ethical issues in the situation?
* The main ethical issue here is the faulty voting machines, and what you should do since you've 
  discovered this defect. In my case, I would probably write off the defect for the first couple
  (maybe the first one or two that I find). At first, I'd definitely find it very odd, and slightly
  confused and concerned as to why this is the case, but I'd assume that perhaps it is a one time 
  occurrence that won't happen again.
* However, if this defect is as common as the prompt suggests, then I would immediately bring this 
  concern/discovery up with my supervisor, and perhaps higher. I'd hope that the company that I am
  working for has a protocol for reporting this kind of situation, so I'd follow protocol.
* Logically, it makes sense that my company would do something about this problem. Even if our 
  code/system isn't what's causing the defect, it is highly likely that we will either be blamed
  or be caught in the backlash should the defect be discovered, so it would make sense for the company
  to verify with the manufacturer, as well as it is the company's duty to ensure that the customer 
  is aware of this fact.
  * Should my company not choose to do anything, then the situation becomes infinitely more complicated.
    I'd probably approach my coworkers and people whom I trust about this situation and ask for their
    advice on what to do. In the end, though, it goes against my conscience to not inform the customer,
    at least in some way, of this defect, so I'd follow through with that.

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
* **1.2 Avoid harm.**
  * The company (mine) should be aware that the lack of action after being informed that such issue
    exists would significantly harm not just the customer, but also their users (the entire populations
    of each state), as well as the company and its workers.
  * If we were to follow the Code, then the course of action following reveal is very obvious and 
    should be executed immediately.
* **1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.**
  * Along with what I said above, to do business correctly (at least in the moral sense) is to 
    be honest and trustworthy. This includes both transparency in products as well as revealing the 
    pretty and ugly sides of the product. 
  * We must be honest in this case and report.
* **1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.**
  * The result of letting such a defect slide is a manipulation of votes, which quite literally
    decide the direction of the government. This could result in discrimination, so we must avoid this
    and prevent it from happening
* 1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
* 1.6 Respect privacy.
* 1.7 Honor confidentiality.

* **2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.**
  * High quality work includes creating non-defective products
* **2.2 Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.**
  * This one is also highly important, along with 2.1. We have to be ethical in our practice and
    report this defect.
* 2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
* 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
* 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
* 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.
* 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
* 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
* 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.

* 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
* 3.2 Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
* 3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
* 3.4 Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.
* 3.5 Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.
* 3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
* 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.


### Useful GVV Pillars (and why)

* Values: 
  * I think a rather easy to relate to value, because appeals less to morality and more self-preservation,
    is that no action would result in harm on the company itself. It'd be too big a risk to take to
    not do so, especially since the clients are state governments
* Choice
* Normalization
* Purpose
* Self-Knowledge & Alignment
* Voice:
  * This is really important. I'd definitely rehearse what to say before actually saying it, not
    only to better my argument, but also to sound more confident when I'm delivering the information
* Reasons & Rationalizations
  * Since this issue is very important, it'd imperative to foresee what the opposing arguments 
    will be and have ready replies on hand.


### Additional Thoughts
* I don't have much in terms of additional thoughts. This really made me think about what I would
  do in this circumstance. Before, I'm not sure what my values were, but after thinking about
  this situation, I think I have a better idea of where I stand.


## Scenario #2

### If you do not have any ethical concerns as presented, what change to the scenario would create issue(s)?
* I definitely have ethical concerns with the situation as presented

### How would handle the ethical issues in the situation?
* This is a hard line to walk. There are many aspects that must be considered:
  1. A deadline is approaching and the supervisor is getting pushy, but the project is a lot more
     complicated and they don't understand this fact.
  2. You have found a potential quick solution, but this would require copying exact code, which
     is not good.
  3. So now the question is: do you copy or do you not copy

* For me, the first thing I'd do is talk to my manager and completely explain the complexity of the project.
  Even though they don't understand now doesn't mean that they won't ever understand. Hopefully, they
  have a track record of being understanding. If not, then I'd approach other coworkers for help
  and ask them to back me up/confirm what I'm saying.
* Then, I'd take inspiration from the code snippets that would solve the issue and implement my
  own way of doing so. I'm not comfortable directly copying code, especially from sources that are 
  outside of the company. Perhaps this will take longer and might not be the most efficient, but at
  least I won't be stealing someone else's work. I'd also make sure to document where this idea/solution
  came from, especially if it is very unique.

### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* 1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
* 1.2 Avoid harm.
* **1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.**
  * This is a huge part of the ethical dilemma/situation here. In order to be honest and trustworthy,
    we cannot copy/take other people's code, and especially without express permission or credit.
* 1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
* **1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.**
  * Parallelling what was said above, we cannot just up and take someone else's code. This would be 
    "disrespecting the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing 
    artifacts."
  * To copy is to disrespect. In order to respect another's work, we must first acknowledge it, and
    then do our best to do something similar.
  * From the manager's side, they must understand that coding takes a lot of time and respect
    the worker's time and effort in completing the project.
* 1.6 Respect privacy.
* 1.7 Honor confidentiality.

* 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
* **2.2 Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.**
  * If we were to copy the code directly, this would shatter the high standards of ethical practice, 
    conduct, and everything else that the Code sets.
* 2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
* 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
* 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
* 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.
* 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
* 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
* 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.

* 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
* 3.2 Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
* 3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
* 3.4 Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.
* 3.5 Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.
* 3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
* 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.


### Useful GVV Pillars (and why)

* Values
* Choice
* Normalization
* Purpose:
  * This is an important one to always keep in mind. What is your purpose in working for the company?
    Is it to appease your managers, to code for yourself, or for the sake of others? What are your
    feelings towards others' work? 
  * Your purpose will define your actions. In my case, my purpose would be to create a product that 
    benefits as many people as possible, while respecting others' work. Thus, I want to create my 
    own solution instead of stealing someone else's
* Self-Knowledge & Alignment
  * Similar to above, once your own morals and values are defined, you must act accordingly. This
    not only helps you stay true to yourself, but also makes making decisions easier and presents
    a coherent package to the rest of your coworkers and company ("setting precedent", almost)
* Voice
* Reasons & Rationalizations
  * The manager might not like what you have to say/request and what you choose to do in this 
    situation. Perhaps they value getting a product out rather than the ethics behind it. Thus, you
    must be able to anticipate their reactions, their arguments, and respond both professionally
    and reasonably so that they may accept your decision (or at least diffuse the situation).


### Additional Thoughts
* I don't have much in terms of additional thoughts. This really made me think about what I would
  do in this circumstance. Before, I'm not sure what my values were, but after thinking about
  this situation, I think I have a better idea of where I stand.
