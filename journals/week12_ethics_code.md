## Scenario #1: Accessibility in Software Development

### Summary of Situation's Ethical Issues
* The company redesigned a text editing feature to be accessible solely through hovering, rather
  than through buttons like they had before. They recognized that this new feature is not inclusive
  to all communities, especially relating to accessibility. Those who are blind or otherwise
  visually impaired, or rely solely on keyboard actions will have lots of difficulty using this
  new feature. The company decided to continue through with this feature despite the realization,
  instead opting to put a line of nonconformity in their accessibility clause and building help 
  pages regarding the new feature. As a result, lots of people, inhibited and not, are confused and
  upset about the new update.

### CARE Process

* CONSIDER who might be affected and how
  * Those who are blind or otherwise visually impaired, or rely solely on keyboard actions are
    impacted greatly by this feature update, as the need to hover over specific text/certain places
    on the webpage is not possible for populations fitting in the descriptions above.
* ANALYZE the situation's details
  * The company redesigned a text editing feature to be accessible solely through hovering, rather
    than through buttons like they had before. They recognized that this new feature is not inclusive
    to all communities, especially relating to accessibility. Those who are blind or otherwise
    visually impaired, or rely solely on keyboard actions will have lots of difficulty using this
    new feature. The company decided to continue through with this feature despite the realization,
    instead opting to put a line of nonconformity in their accessibility clause and building help
    pages regarding the new feature. As a result, lots of people, inhibited and not, are confused and
    upset about the new update.
* REVIEW other obligations and limitations
  * The company has a responsibility to take care of all of its customers, including those who are
    visually impaired and/or disabled in some way. 
  * It is obvious that the correct action to take is to leave the feature as is, or update it in 
    a way that does not negatively impact the user experience of the populations affected
  * A possible solution is having both click and hover options, or switching between modes (old vs new)
* EVALUATE the best course of action
  * The action that the company chose to take was by no means the best course of action. In fact, it
    was quite close to the worst possible solution. Instead of caring for its customers, the company
    decided to fold into the pressure exerted by higher-ups and continue on with the feature, instead
    opting to create a (useless) help page. 
  * I think the best course of action would be to have both button and hover options, and users 
    can specify which mode they want to use in settings. This way, there will 
    1. Still be a new feature
    2. The feature will reach the goal of decluttering space
    3. Those who depend on buttons will still be able to use the product and feel supported


### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* **1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.**
  * The company was not thinking about this clause when making the decision to launch the new 
    feature, despite clear accessibility defects. Had they cared about this clause, they would have
    forgone the launch in favor of resolving the issue.
* **1.2 Avoid harm.**
  * Had this clause been in mind when designing the feature, then all issues would have been avoided.
    Since the feature brings harm not only to the customers but also the company (backlash, dealing
    with unhappy customers and stakeholders, etc), the plan should've never been executed and they 
    should've instead focused on making a feature with better reviews.
* <span style="color:grey">1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.</span>
* **1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.**
  * Clearly this feature discriminates against those with additional accessibility needs. The new
    feature completely wipes out the entire disabled customer base, discriminating against them
    as a result.
* <span style="color:grey">1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative 
  works, and computing artifacts.</span>
* <span style="color:grey">1.6 Respect privacy.</span>
* <span style="color:grey">1.7 Honor confidentiality.</span>

* <span style="color:grey">2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work. </span>
* <span style="color:grey">2.2 Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice. </span>
* **2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.**
  * The company already had an existing accessibility policy and accessibility guidance and best 
    practices. The designers, when planning the new feature, didn't look at this. If they had, then
    this entire situation could have been avoided.
* <span style="color:grey">2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review. </span>
* <span style="color:grey">2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks. </span>
* <span style="color:grey">2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure. </span>

* <span style="color:grey"> 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.2 Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.4 Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.5 Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society. </span>

## Scenario #2: Abusive Workplace Behavior

### Summary of Situation's Ethical Issues
* Diane is a hardworking programmer who has made several impactful contributions in research projects
  in her new job in the industry. She begun working for Max, a highly reputable person in the field. 
  However, Max is verbally abusive to anyone who makes a mistake, and frequently punishes female
  members on the team by leaving their name out of published papers. Diane made a mistake before a 
  demo, and as a result, was not allowed to participate in the demo. She took her concerns up to 
  a higher up, who essentially told her to deal with it.

### CARE Process

* CONSIDER who might be affected and how
  * Diane and the rest of the people working under Max are affected by his abusive and misogynistic
    behavior, receiving emotional abuse and often not being credited for their work/contributions.
* ANALYZE the situation's details
  * Diane is a hardworking programmer who has made several impactful contributions in research projects
    in her new job in the industry. She begun working for Max, a highly reputable person in the field.
    However, Max is verbally abusive to anyone who makes a mistake, and frequently punishes female
    members on the team by leaving their name out of published papers. Diane made a mistake before a
    demo, and as a result, was not allowed to participate in the demo. She took her concerns up to
    a higher up, who essentially told her to deal with it.
* REVIEW other obligations and limitations
  * Not only is Max at fault for abusing his coworkers and power, but the team manager is also at 
    fault for not doing anything despite Diane's complaints.
  * An alternative is that Jean will investigate into this matter and talk to Max about his behavior.
* EVALUATE the best course of action
  * The way that both Max and Jean reacted are not correct in this situation. Jean should've taken
    Diane's words more to heart and investigated Max, even if he is a major contributor to many papers.
    This would entail talking to other people working under Max.


### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* **1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.**
  * Max's words are not contributing to the human well-being of the team, causing everyone stress,
    unhappiness, and general discomfort.
* <span style="color:grey"> 1.2 Avoid harm. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 1.3 Be honest and trustworthy. </span>
* **1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.**
  * Max's actions are misogynistic and discriminate against the female members of the team.
* **1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.**
  * Max consistently leaves people's names out of papers and doesn't allow them to take credit for their
    own work, which is clearly a violation of this clause. Not only does he have no respect for 
    his coworkers, he is actively undermining them.
* <span style="color:grey"> 1.6 Respect privacy. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 1.7 Honor confidentiality. </span>

* <span style="color:grey"> 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work. </span>
* **2.2 Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.**
  * Yelling and abusive words are never the correct way to communicate, and is far from maintaining
    professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice. He must work on this.
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure. </span>

* <span style="color:grey"> 3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.2 Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group. </span>
* **3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.**
  * Jean did not take Diane's words to heart, enabling Max's abuse and allowing him to continue 
    his bad behavior. This detracts from the quality of working life.
* **3.4 Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.**
  * By allowing Max to continue his normal operations, Jean is disregarding the company's policies
    against discrimination, abuse, and the principles of the Code.
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.5 Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems. </span>
* <span style="color:grey"> 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society. </span>

## Scenario #3: Dark UX Patterns

### Summary of Situation's Ethical Issues
* Stewart, a UX designer, received some very suspicious instructions from the client, including
  adding hidden functionalities to traditionally "innocent" buttons, and misaligning the traditional
  buttons meanings with actions that do other functions, such as adding product, adding a protection
  warranty, etc. In addition, the color scheme that was requested was red/green, which would cause
  those with disability difficulty seeing the button text. He brought his concerns up with his
  manager, who told him to just do what he was told. Later at a company celebration, Stewart heard
  comments made by some managers that confirmed his suspicions -- these dark requests were intended,
  and that the change in color scheme was meant to take advantage of those with colorblindness.

### CARE Process

* CONSIDER who might be affected and how
  * The users of the client's website (customers), especially those who are color blind, are 
    severely affected. The clients are forced to accidentally buy extra inventory/products that they
    did not want. Colorblind customers are discriminated against and cannot easily use the website.
* ANALYZE the situation's details

    comments made by some managers that confirmed his suspicions -- these dark requests were intended,
    and that the change in color scheme was meant to take advantage of those with colorblindness.
* REVIEW other obligations and limitations
  * The first manager could have handled the situation better. He should have investigated the client
    for malicious intentions and told Stewart to not follow through with the instructions.
* EVALUATE the best course of action
  * The best course of action would be for the (first) manager to investigate this case and accurately 
    report the malicious intents of the company/client. However, this is provided that the manager 
    themselves weren't involved in the collusion (unlikely).


### Applicable Parts of the Code (and why)

* **1.1 Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.**
  * The people working in Stewarts company are not contribute to society and to human well-being. 
    Instead they are actively working against society/the customers.
* **1.2 Avoid harm.**
  * The customers of the client are clearly harmed by the malicious actions of the client.
* **1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.**
  * The client is deliberately being dishonest with their website
* **1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.**
  * Those with colorblindness/other disabilities are being discriminated against.
* 1.5 Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
* 1.6 Respect privacy.
* 1.7 Honor confidentiality.

* 2.1 Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
* 2.2 Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.
* 2.3 Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
* 2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
* **2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.**
  * The company should've more thoroughly investigated the changes requested by the client for 
    authenticity and non malicious intent.
* 2.6 Perform work only in areas of competence.
* 2.7 Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
* 2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
* 2.9 Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.

* **3.1 Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.**
  * The managers at the company at the party knew exactly what was going on, but did not do anything
    to expose the client. As a result, they have violated this clause, by not protecting the public
    good.
* 3.2 Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
* 3.3 Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
* **3.4 Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.**
  * Stewart's company should put policies into place to ensure that this kind of occurrence doesn't happen again.
* 3.5 Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.
* 3.6 Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
* 3.7 Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.

## Response to using the Code
* I think the Code is very reasonable and is something that every company, organization, and 
  establishment should follow to ensure the protection of their workers, customers, and people
  of the world. I don't think the Code is particularly demanding-- it's only looking for the bare
  minimum in terms of what companies should follow in order to remain ethical in their 
  operations.

## Response to the quote about releasing software is an uncontrolled experiment
* With the way software is, it is natural that the "testing" environment also happens to be the 
  entire population/whoever chooses to interact with the software. This is both great and has 
  potential for real harm. 
* The fact that it is viewed as an experimental process gives software engineers leeway in terms of 
  the level of perfection that is expected of them (benefit), but at the same time also gives them
  an excuse when things turn out to be unethical, have an negative impact, or go awry in some way.
  In the wrong hands, this can be easily abused, taking advantage of the unassuming everyday 
  consumer.
* For example, a company may not demand absolute perfection from their developer team since they 
  understand this quote and the general environment. This contributes to ethical treatment, 
  since the workers are being treated with respect, distance, and are not pushed to the max always.
  However, a more malicious company may take advantage of this, purposefully releasing a product that
  is malicious in some way (ie scams people out of their money, deliberately insecure, products that
  don't last very long and thus need frequent replacements, etc) and when exposed for this, claim that
  they were unaware of this problem, and that they should be forgiven, per this quote.
