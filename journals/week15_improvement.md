## Habits

* Some to keep
  * A habit that is worth it to continue beyond this course is planning what the project will 
    entail, down to the API and specific structures. Especially when working in a team, this 
    makes things a lot easier and does leave teammates guessing as to what is what, and what 
    functions they can use/what they're called.
  * Another habit that is work continuing is thinking about design before coding, or at least
    coding with the expectation that eventually, things will be added to the project, and that 
    means you must make it easier for yourself from the start, rather than going back and fixing it
    at a later time.

* Some not worth keeping
  * I really didn't like my work habits this semester. I would constantly pull all nighters
    working on project and getting features/design in. I felt that this was extremely 
    unhealthy and definitely isn't sustainable in the long run. Especially in the long run,
    I'd like to maintain a good work-life balance, only working on code during certain hours of 
    the day (aka the work day) and then not doing so for the time that I'm supposed to be resting
  * Of course, I recognize that this is hard while still in school, because there's so much other
    stuff to balance and do as well, including other classes, homework, project, and tests, as
    well as extracurricular activities and the duties and responsibilities that com attached
    to such activities. 
  * Regardless, in the workplace, I hope to maintain some sort of balance to avoid the suffering
    that I went through this semester.

* Some to explore later
  * I think there are a lot more aspects of design that I need to explore. To be completely 
    honest, it takes me quite a while to be able to get used to one thing, so I wasn't able to 
    learn everything in class very deeply or well. I'd like to continue exploring how to improve
    design.

* Value of checklists?
  * The checklist is so valuable and so helpful! It's such a great resource to keep, as it just
    contains a nice succinct list of everything that's important about code design. There are 
    rules that you should follow, things that you should avoid, and so much more that's on there,
    and I think it's really great.


## Programming Skills

* Delightful code
  * I really enjoyed Reflections. I never knew of the existence of Class, Method, etc classes, and 
    being able to use them for Relflections is really cool. It seems almost magical in a way
    and I love it. Even though sometimes it can be a little annoying to use, in general I think
    it's a really cool, interesting, and helpful concept
  * I also really liked learning about .css files and how you can customize everything without 
    hard-coding value in, especially being able to assign tags to elements so that you can 
    dictate the design of that specific thing.

* Lessons from worst coding experience
  * My absolute worst coding experience this semester, and probably in my entire life was the
    entire first group project. My teammates were not very on top of the work, leaving me to do
    the majority of the project. From that, I learned that it is very important to find good 
    teammates to do coding project with. In the case that your teammates/coworkers are not very
    good, it is imperative to TELL other people this, and ask for either advice, or a change, or
    for some upper person to go and talk to them. This would happen, of course, after you yourself
    go and talk to them. 

* Lessons from best coding experience
  * The best coding experience I had was working on Slogo. Objectively, my current group (for
    oogasalad) is by far the best group I've worked in, but my experience is marred by the tanking
    of my mental health and everything essentially going wrong in my life. Thus, my best coding 
    experience is the project before that. I remember one instance in which a teammmate and I 
    randomly hopped on a zoom call and in one go, properly connected some of our features together,
    which was really cool.

* Interesting skills beyond coding
  * To be honest, I don't think I'm half bad at frontend/UIUX. Oogasalad was the first time
    I worked on front end and designed anything that the user would interact with, and I think 
    I did a pretty okay job. I enjoyed using figma to connect everything and really appreciated
    how nice all of the features were. 


## Personal

* Personal strengths
  * I think my biggest strength is my work ethic and stubbornness. I don't like to leave things
    unfinished, so I will often work until the goal that I set out for myself I reached. I am 
    very passionate about what I do, and when that is the case, I will dedicate as much time 
    into the project as needed until the result is something I am satisfied and can be proud 
    of.

* Personal weaknesses
  * My weakness is my lack of knowledge and also lack of ability to assert myself. In a sense, 
    I guess that stems from the idea that I am very open to everything, and don't have much 
    in the way of preferences/thoughts for how things should be done. I am very go along with the
    flow, and as such, people may view me as a pushover or not participating much. I should work
    on this aspect of myself.

* Habits to stop
  * A habit that I need to step is something that I've already talked about before. I need to stop
    working so late in the night. I guess my strength (stubbornness/perfection) is very detrimental,
    as I can easily sacrifice my physical and mental health for something that I care about.
  * Something that I learned to stop doing this semester was the need to know every single thing
    that was going on in a project. At first, I did not feel confident trusting my teammates to 
    do their own work, and I would constantly stress about it. However, I learned to let that go,
    and trust that whatever they're doing, they're doing it correctly. 

* Personal development steps
  * To continue developing my skills in the future, I want to take more CS classes and learn much
    more about the world of CS. I'd like to try my hand at AI and machine learning, at frontend, 
    UI/UX, and web development, and so much more. I'll continue to seek out internships to gain
    more real world experience, while continuing to expand my knowledge base in classes.
