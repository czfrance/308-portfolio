## Summary of Ethical Issue
As technology becomes ever more prevalent in our society, activities using these technologies has also
increased significantly. Of those, gaming, or games played on the computer/other devices is one of the
most popular forms of technological consumption. 

In a way, gaming reaches an audience broader than all other facets of technology combined. Since they're
so adaptable, people of all ages-- toddlers, young adults, mature adults-- all play the games that 
they find the most interesting to them. And as such, its effect on the people of the world is 
naturally greater as well.

In part due to its adaptability, the design of a game-- its graphics, content, theme, mesage, etc-- 
can drastically alter, and in the case of toddlers/young children maybe even define, a player's
outlook on life and the lens through which they view the world. Game designers have the responsibility
of foreseeing and addressing the ethical issues that arise from their game's consumption.

In particular, a common ethical issue involving gaming is the stereotyping of women. As the gaming
population is still heavily skewed towards the male population, many games are created with the 
intent of 'catering' to them. This oftentimes involves the stereotyping of women as weak, as objects,
and as property or tools to use for some end.

## Perspective 1
The most obvious perspective on this, then, is that this situation is unacceptable. Game designers'
focus on catering to their consumers is negatively impacting society's views on women and quite
frankly working to undo all progress that's been made in regard to female empowerment and rights.
Their portrayal of women as weak objects would reinforce, change, or even define a player's view
of women for the worse. This is unacceptable. Programmers and designers must think past what 
'makes them the most money' and to the broader societal implications & effects of their products.
They must not only be aware but also be held responsible, called out, even, for creating products that 
would increase discrimination against women.

## Perspective 2
Another perspective is that games are games. They are made to represent a world that is not ours,
so why should programmers and designers need to have to think about these topics? People play 
games to have fun, not to argue about societal morals, views, stereotypes, etc. Thus, games are
fine the way they are. They shouldn't be changed, and most certainly don't need some sort of 
regulatory/impact checking department.

## Personal Analysis
I think it's quite clear which perspective I agree with. Gaming reaches all ages of people, and thus
has an effect on all generations of the population. Even though games are made for fun, it is 
undeniable that they have an effect on players that beyond just 'interest/relief'. We as humans
are constantly learning, so we are also learning from the games we play, unconsciously associating
certain events with certain responses. Thus, programmers have the responsibility of ensuring that
their product will not inadvertently hinder society's views.

## Impact
Of course, these ethical issues extend beyond just gaming to all aspects of technology. Although I'm
not sure what section/faction I will go into in the future, I will definitely remember to think
through the ethical nature of a project before starting, and to have this conversation with all of 
my team members and the entire company.
