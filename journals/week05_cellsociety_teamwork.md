## TEAM NUMBER 03


### Contributions and Roles

* Describe your role(s) and your satisfaction
    Although we split up responsibilities at the beginning of the project, I've become sort of like
    a jack-of-all trades. During the preliminary stages of the project, I set up both the back-end
    and front-end framework and de-bugged all the code to make sure things were working. I was also 
    the team member that created the XML file formatting (tags) and wrote the parser to intake 
    information. Since then, I've completed multiple simulations: Percolation, Schelling's, Spreading
    of Fire, and debugged Game of Life; and created example XML simulations```.

    In terms of general team responsibilities, I'd definitely consider myself to be the organized 
    one. It seems like most of the time, the other members of my team don't even know most of the 
    specifications. One team member in particular, Diane Kim, did not do any work voluntarily until
    I texted her personally to ask her to work on a part of the project. I also get the feeling that
    of the part she's doing, she doesn't understand what the parameters/requirements of the project
    are, so I'll have to probably fix her work/add in the required sections too.

    I am far from satisfied in terms of my team. It feels that when I am not working, no one takes the
    initiative to work. In terms of myself, I am also not satisfied. These past few weeks have been
    very busy, stressful, and hard form me and as such, I've found it hard to find time to work on the
    project consistently. As a result, I've stayed up extremely late more days than not.

* Describe your team mate(s) role(s) and their satisfaction

    * **Diane Kim**: Diane's responsibility is to be in charge of the view. So far, she's added 
      buttons and panes to the UI. However, I'm not sure if she understands what is required of the
      view for the project. For example, she added an English properties file, but hasn't used it.
      In addition, she frequently needs reminders to work on her work and I feel as if she doesn't 
      contribute as much as the rest of us. Commit history indicates that she's contributed far less
      than Jose and I. In addition, she hasn't been to class this entire week.

    * **Jose Santillan**: Jose's been contributing to the back-end/model of our project. He wrote the
      logic for Game of Life and completed WaTor as well as created some example XML configurations.
      I am satisfied with Jose's contributions/role on the team. Him and I are closer to being on
      the same page and he is easy to work with.


### Team Events

* Describe when you felt the most satisfaction: 
  * This is a low standard, but I felt most satisfaction when we met the lowest requirements for
    the "basic" part of the assignment (bare bones English properties, 3 simulations, a recognizable
    UI)

* Describe when you felt the team made the biggest leap ahead:
  * After Jose and I puzzled out the whole process of added a simulation/completed Game of Life (he 
    did the logic & I debugged and created the grid view). This made adding the following simulations
    much easier to implement.

* Describe way(s) the team has worked well
  * Jose and I had quite a few productive conversations when we were working on the project.

* Describe problem(s) with the way the team worked together
  * The people on the team don't work consistently. Some people need to be told what to do and don't
    take initiative to do work on their own. We've also had trouble meeting up in person. 


### Learning Opportunities

* Your biggest strength as a team member
  * I think my biggest strength is working hard on the project. No matter what, I will contribute
    as much as possible and will always do what I said I would do, if not more.

* Your biggest weakness as a team member
  * I have quite a few weaknesses. Some of them include: 
    1. procrastinating- I rarely work in the beginning of the week. This is due to a multitude of factors
       including other school work & commitments.
    2. communication- I think I've gotten better at this during this project (I communicate what I do and
       ask others to do their part if need be, information I get from my TA, etc), but I can always be 
       clearer in communicating my thoughts and ideas.
    3. organization: Although it seemed like I was the most organized person on this team, in reality
       I am not very organized compared to other people. Usually, I have an idea/overall picture
       of what is required but need to go back to the website often to check for details.
    4. trust: I come in trusting my teammates, but whenever something happens that causes the trust
       to waver, I become paranoid and stressed about other parts of the project.

* What you have learned team collaboration/communication during this project
  * I learned that especially for big projects like this, where it is not really feasible for one 
    person to do everything, it is really important for everyone to contribute. Not only should there
    be trust amongst all the members of the team, but we should also be comfortable sharing our
    own opinions to the group.

* A specific thing can you do to make team collaboration/communication more productive
  * It would be great if the team could find a time to work together that isn't the weekend a day 
    before the project is due.
